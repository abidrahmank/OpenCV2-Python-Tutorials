    * OpenCV functions for that : **cv2.Canny()**
    
Theory
=========

Canny Edge Detection is a popular edge detection algorithm. It was developed by John F. Canny in 1986. It is a multi-stage algorithm and we will go through each stage.

1. **Noise Reduction**

Since edge detection is susceptible to noise in the image, first step is to remove the noise in the image with a 5x5 Gaussian filter. We have already seen this in previous chapters. 

2. **Finding Intensity Gradient of the Image**

Smoothened image is then filtered with a Sobel kernel in both horizontal and vertical direction to get first derivative in horizontal direction (:math:`G_x`) and vertical direction (:math:`G_y`). From these two images, we can find edge gradient and direction for each pixel as follows:

.. math::

    Edge\_Gradient \; (G) = \sqrt{G_x^2 + G_y^2}

    Angle \; (\theta) = \tan^{-1} \bigg(\frac{G_y}{G_x}\bigg)

Gradient direction is always perpendicular to edges. It is rounded to one of four angles representing vertical, horizontal and two diagonal directions.

3. **Non-maximum Suppression**

After getting gradient magnitude and direction, a full scan of the image is done to remove any unwanted pixel which may not constitute the edge. For this, at every pixel, one checks if it is a local maximum in its neighborhood in the direction of the gradient. Check the image below:

    .. image:: images/nms.jpg
        :alt: Non-Maximum Suppression
        :align: center
        
Point A is on the edge (in vertical direction). Gradient direction is normal to the edge. Point B and C are in gradient direction. So point A is checked with point B and C to see if it forms a local maximum. If so, it is considered for next stage, otherwise, it is suppressed (put to zero).

In short, the result you get is an image with "thin edges".

4. **Hysteresis Thresholding**

This stage decides which of all edges are really edges and which are not. For this, we need two threshold values, `minVal` and `maxVal`. Any edge with intensity gradient greater than `maxVal` is sure to be an edge ("sure-edge") and any edge below `minVal` is sure to be an non-edge, hence discarded. Those which lie between these two thresholds are classified edges or non-edges based on their connectivity. If they are connected to "sure-edge" pixels, they are considered to be part of edges. Otherwise, they are also discarded. See the image below:

    .. image:: images/hysteresis.jpg
        :alt: Hysteresis Thresholding
        :align: center

The edge A is above `maxVal`, hence considered as "sure-edge". Although edge C is below `maxVal`, it is connected to edge A, so that it is also considered as a valid edge and we get that full curve. But when it comes to edge B, although it is above `minVal` and in same region as edge C, it is not connected to any "sure-edge", so that it is discarded. So it is very important that we select `minVal` and `maxVal` accordingly, to get the correct result.

This stage also removes small pixel noise on the assumption that edges are long lines. 

So what we finally get is strong edges in the image.

Canny Edge Detection in OpenCV
===============================

OpenCV puts all the above in a single function, **cv2.Canny()**. We will see how to use it. First argument is our input image. Second and third arguments are our `minVal` and `maxVal` respectively. Third argument is `aperture_size`. It is the size of Sobel kernel used for find image gradients. By default it is 3. Last argument is `L2gradient` which specifies the equation for finding gradient magnitude. If it is ``True``, it uses the equation mentioned above which is more accurate, otherwise it uses this function: :math:`Edge\_Gradient \; (G) = |G_x| + |G_y|`. By default, it is ``False``.
::

    import cv2
    import numpy as np
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

    img = cv2.imread('messi5.jpg',0)
    edges = cv2.Canny(img,100,200)

    plt.subplot(121),plt.imshow(img,cmap = 'gray')
    plt.title('Original Image'), plt.xticks([]), plt.yticks([])
    plt.subplot(122),plt.imshow(edges,cmap = 'gray')
    plt.title('Edge Image'), plt.xticks([]), plt.yticks([])

    plt.show() 
    
See the result below:
